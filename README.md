# dat510-assignments
 
 These are my obligatory assigments for the course "Security and vulnerability in networks". 
 
 In the assigments we learned and practiced topics such as:
 
 #1 Simple-DES, TripleDES, Mono-alphabetic ciphers
 
 #2 Communication over two different networks, symmetric ciphers, PRNG, Public-key cryptography (PKI)-based key exchange protocol
 
 #3 Signing and validation of messages. Hash functions, Signature Scheme DSS. 
 
 
All the folders containt separate README files for how to program works and how to run them.
